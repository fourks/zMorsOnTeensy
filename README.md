Using:
- red lines are presets
- yellow lines are module titles
- blue lines are connection points (select one of 32 buses to make connections between the modules)
- green lines are module parameters (0.0 ..... 1.0)

Current Setup contains
- 2 osc (sin,saw,pw)
- 1 noise
- 1 vca
- 1 low pass filter
- 1 AD envelope
- 1 8 step cv sequencer
- 4 analog in
- 2 analog out

Roadmap
- performance adc
- tune osc
- improve ui
- add eagle files
- add presets
